# JTwine-to-JSON
A story format for converting a Twine 2 story to JSON with special support for Harlowe 3.x. Specifically created for MSCH-C220 at Indiana University—Bloomington.

JTwine-to-JSON makes a few useful changes to [Twine-to-JSON](https://jtschoonhoven.github.io/twine-to-json/), which was inspired by [Twison](https://github.com/lazerwalker/twison). Twison was, in turn, inspired by [Entweedle](http://www.maximumverbosity.net/twine/Entweedle/).

## Setup

From the Twine 2 homescreen, select the Twine Menu, then "Story Format". "+ Add" a New Format. At the prompt, "Paste in the address below": `https://cdn.githubraw.com/BL-MSCH-C220/JTwine-to-JSON/main/format.js`


## Export

Once you’ve installed format, enter your story and choose Change Story Format. Select the new format and return to your story. Selecting Play will generate a JSON file in your browser. It can then be copied for use elsewhere.
